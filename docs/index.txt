PyJS is a JavaScript library and its goal is to imitate Python syntax, simplify
code writing and remove differences between browsers.


=== Features
The most significant feature of PyJS is modifying JavaScript Objects,
particularly native objects like `Object`, `Array` or `String` and make them
easy to use.

It takes ideas from famous libraries like Dojo, Prototype or jQuery, but with a
Pythonic syntax.

Main features:

 * BSD licencing
 * New methods to Javascript objects
 * Easy ways to manipulate DOM nodes
 * Modules managing and packaging
 * Use of class
 * link:debug_testing.html[
        Adding test in code, with a way to remove them when packaging
    ]
 * And lots of other things ...
