The best way to get and update the last version is

The only thing to do in order to update the whole
repository is:

  git pull

If you just need a working version to embed in your website,
just download the link:http://hotgloupi.fr/xd.py.js[last version].

Or you can pack it yourself link:sandbox[here]
