== Getting started

First of all, you must download PyJS link:download.html[here].

this archive contains the doc reference of the library (in `docs`) and the
library it-self : the sub-directory `pyjs`.

You only need to place it at the root of your site, and include it with
something like :

{{{
<html>
  <head>
     <script type="text/javascript" src="/pyjs/core/core.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
}}}

You can use the library in next `script` tag :D
