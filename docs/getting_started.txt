== Getting started

=== Include the bootstrap file

First of all, you must download PyJS link:download.html[here]. This archive
contains the doc reference of the library (in `docs`) and the library it-self :
the sub-directory `pyjs`.

You only need to place it at the root of your site, and include it with
something like :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<html>
  <head>
     <script type="text/javascript" src="/pyjs/core/core.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the library in next `script` tag :D

=== Profit !
You can right now use all of PyJS library within the namespace `py`.
We will introduce you some basic tutorials to get into it as fast as
possible. You might want to keep open the
link:http://reference.pyjs.info[reference manual] and full
link:docs.html[documentation] when things need more explanation.

==== First overview


==== Where to look know
Next step is reading the full link:docs.html[documentation].
